### [Coursera Capstone Case Study 2 - How Well Can A Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FOvUsrNZPZ1q3WE77Lf2B5Gix7bMh7GcN5JaPFcPdXU/edit?usp=sharing)
Within this case study, I investigated how different people use the Bellabeat smart devices and utilise the functions provided. Using R (Posit) Cloud and a dataset provided by Bellabeat from 30 volunteers, I was able to understand how these trends could influence the customers as well as a revisitation of Bellabeatâ€™s marketing strategy.

### [Top Ranked Movies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17UirxkLnWj22IS2SBI9tnczdvKsVB1-OFVsoHlyE7TM/edit?usp=sharing)
I have gathered several datasets that provide unique insights into the most popular movies worldwide to identify any trends that may emerge and provide an insight into what makes a successful film, both currently and over the past few years.
